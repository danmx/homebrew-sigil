        To use sigil you need to install AWS session-manager-plugin:
        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html

        To see if you have it already installed run:
            sigil verify
        EOS
    end

    test do
        system "sigil" "--version"
    end
end
